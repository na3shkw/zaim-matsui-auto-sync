- All future memories and persistent instructions should be recorded in this `GEMINI.md` file.
  - Because the development environment is a devcontainer.
- The user will run the `npm start` command manually. I should not run it myself, as it fails due to network issues in my execution environment.
- Use a 2-space indent for nested lists in this file.
